### Which component is affected?

Qwik Runtime

### Describe the bug

When using the asChild prop on a component, specifically in prod, the checkbox breaks (indicator no longer shows and hides)

Not sure what asChild is? Read more about it here:

https://qwik.design/contributing/composition/#what-is-aschild

> I think asChild makes a lot of sense to be part of the framework, as it is a powerful primitive that enables the ability for consumers to provide their own JSX. Currently, we need to create an inline component for each component that supports asChild.

isolating the issue:

1. It works in production again after removing the aria-checked element, which seems to be using the isCheckedSig that changes on click:

```tsx
 aria-checked={context.isCheckedSig.value}
```



### Reproduction

https://github.com/thejackshelton/v2-repro-aschild/

### Steps to reproduce

Reproduction steps:

1. pnpm i && pnpm preview
2. notice that the checkbox does not check or toggle, and there is an error from qwik core in the console

working behavior:

1. run dev mode
2. notice that it is toggling in dev mode
